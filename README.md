# Robbery-Detection-and-Classification-Using-Pretrained-MobileNetV7
This shoplifting detection system extracts frames from a video, detects people using Haar cascades, and tracks them across frames using KCF tracking. A pre-trained model predicts suspicious activity, and a green rectangle highlights detected individuals. The visualization ensures accurate tracking and detection
